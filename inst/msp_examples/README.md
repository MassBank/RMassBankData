#Running RMassBank with msp data

Currently, the only supported way of creating MassBank records from msp data is to read the msp files and create records using the `mbWorkflow`. A script to accomplish this is added in this folder. Try to source `run_msp_example.R` in an R Console to create an infolist from the given msp files.
Until now, it is not supported to further analyze msp data using the msmsWorkflow.
